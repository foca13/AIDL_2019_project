# AIDL_2019_project

## Introduction

The initial idea of this project was to develop a face detection network for The first We tested two different architectures: 

In the second part of the project, we splitted the group individually and each member of the group had to implement a siamese with shared weights with a VGG pretrained with

## Architecture


## Hyperparameters

In order to test the training efficiency of the networks and compare between (...) The table below shows the 


Learning rate: This parameter determines how fast the network converges to the minimum of the loss function

Weight decay: 

Data augmentation: This parameter helps to improve generalization, as it adds noise and other small perturbations to the training images 

Number of epochs:
